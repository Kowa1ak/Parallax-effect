### Description

The parallax effect is a visual effect in which the background and foreground move at different speeds when scrolling a page. This creates the illusion of depth and immerses the site visitor into the atmosphere of your content.


1. **HTML structure:** First, I created a web page structure with sections in which I would like to use the parallax effect. These can be sections with images, text, and other content elements.

2. **CSS for positioning:** I used CSS to position elements on the page and set them initial styles. The main thing at this stage is to make sure that the background of the section has a fixed or relative positioning, depending on the desired effect.

3. **JavaScript for handling scroll events:** Using JavaScript, I added event handlers to scroll the page. When scrolling, I changed the positions of the elements depending on the scrolling position, creating a parallax effect. This can be done using window.Scrollly to determine the current scroll position and change CSS properties such as transform, translate, opacity and others to create an impressive motion effect.

4. **Speed and direction adjustment:** I also adjusted the speed and direction of movement of the elements to achieve the desired visual effect. This can be done, for example, by changing the conversion coefficients when scrolling.

5. **Animations and Transitions:** For smooth and colorful transitions between states, I used CSS animations and transitions. This added an attractive effect to the page and made parallax more attractive.
